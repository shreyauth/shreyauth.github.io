# API Documentation

The Shrey Auth activations API is organized around REST. This is done so responses are
predictable. Requests will take parameters via **query strings** and **JSON**, and will return
**JSON** to you.

### Root URL
> API requests will be sent to your Shrey Auth connected site. This helps filter requests based on your users.
The root URL follows the pattern:
```
yoursite.com/api/v1/
```
